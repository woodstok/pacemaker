Pacemaker
===============
This is a spotify app almost entirely based on the [Static Playlisting](http://static.echonest.com/playlist-demo/)

I have been trying for a while to bring it to completion. This app would help the user in creating a spotify playlist based on artists, songs, tempo, danceability, energy etc.

I see much use in the tempo filter which i can use to get songs for a particular BPM for running (hence the name pacemaker)

Remember to replace the api_key variable in static_files/app.js to your echonest developer key(if you don't have one, register for one. it is free, and would take just 5 minutes )

| Closure of Spotify Apps Submissions   |
| ------------------------------------- |
| Spotify closed the submission process for new apps on the 24th of March 2014. You can still develop apps, but your app will not be released through the App Finder and will thus not be accessible to other users. Please read the [announcement](http://devnews.spotify.com/2014/03/24/closure-of-spotify-apps-submissions/) on our Developer News site for more information. |
This means that you would have to have a developer account in spotify ( also echonest ) . Both are very easy to create.
